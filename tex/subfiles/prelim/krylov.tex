\section{Iterations methods}
To solve the system of the form \(Ax=b\), a basic iteration method is solve a system that is similar that is more easily solved, \(Mx_0=b\). Using the solution as an approximation to the original system and a correction, \(A(x_0+z)=b\), we have a new system. Using the same nearby system to solve the new system, \(Az=b-Ax_0\), we get \(Mz_0=b-Ax_0\).


Meaning we solve the system \(Mx_0=b\) and use \(x_0\) as an approximation of the solution to the original problem. Then
